As machine learning algorithms mature, the biggest challenge in making AI work is to improve the quality and scale of the data required to train AI. In our experience most AI projects fail because existing data platforms lack the reliability, flexibility and performance to effectively develop and deploy AI systems. We systematically engineer data so it can be used by AI systems to improve your business, drive innovation and enable data-based decision intelligence. We call that data-centric AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplied AI\nThe possibilities of AI are virtually endless and can fundamentally change the way you run your business or lead your organisation. It changes business strategies, policies as well as the behaviour of your teams. If your company embarks on integrating AI, it needs to do what is relevant and what you want it for. We developed impactful AI applications that are accurate, taking into account the factors that drive the predictions and relating it to domain expertise. We help you integrate AI innovations in your services or products.\nExplainable AI | Generative AI & Large Language Models | Physics-Informed Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoaching & mentoring\nData and AI will change your business and your way of working.
